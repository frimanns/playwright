# Using Playwright for testing

Playwright is a powerful tool for end-to-end testing of modern web applications. Developed by Microsoft, it supports multiple browsers like Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit, and can be used across different platforms and languages, including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, .NET, and Java12.

Some key features of Playwright include:

* Cross-browser testing: Ensures your web app works on different browsers.
* Auto-wait: Automatically waits for elements to be ready before interacting with them, reducing flaky tests.
* Web-first assertions: Designed for dynamic web applications, retrying checks until conditions are met.
* Tracing and debugging tools: Capture execution traces, screenshots, and videos to help debug test failures.
* Full isolation: Each test runs in a separate browser context, providing complete isolation without overhead1
