# Playwright in VS Code

Using Playwright with Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a great way to write and run end-to-end tests for web applications. Here’s a quick guide to get you started

1. Install the Playwright Extension
    * Open VS Code and go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
    * Search for “Playwright Test for VSCode” and install the extension1.
2. Set Up Playwright
    * Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type Install Playwright.
    * Select Test: Install Playwright and choose the browsers you want to test on (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit).
    * Optionally, you can set up GitHub Actions for continuous integration2.
3. Create and Run Tests
    * The extension will create a tests folder with example tests and a playwright.config file.
    * You can run tests by clicking the green triangle next to the test block or from the testing sidebar2.
4. Debugging and Locators
    * Use the “Pick Locator” feature to identify elements on the page.
    * You can also record tests by performing actions in the browser, which Playwright will convert into test code1
5. Viewing Results
    * Test results, including any errors, will be displayed in the testing sidebar.
    * You can run tests in headless mode or with the browser window open to see the actions being performed2.

For more detailed instructions, you can check out the [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-vscode)

# Another method is using PowerShell

Use the command npm init playwright@latest --yes -- --quiet --browser=chromium --browser=firefox --browser=webkit --gha 

Example

```bash

mkdir my_web_test
cd my_web_test
npm init playwright@latest --yes -- --quiet --browser=chromium --browser=firefox --browser=webkit --gha
```


Here’s a breakdown of what each part does:

```

npm init playwright@latest: Initializes a new Playwright project using the latest version.  
--yes   Automatically answers 'yes' to any prompts during the setup.  
--      Forwarding additional options  
--quiet Runs the command without outputting unnecessary information.  
--browser=chromium --browser=firefox --browser=webkit  Installs support for Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers.  
--gha   This flag is specific to setting up GitHub Actions for Playwright.  
        It configures the project to include a GitHub Actions workflow file for running tests in a CI/CD pipeline123.  
```

This command is particularly useful for quickly setting up a Playwright project with all necessary configurations for cross-browser testing and continuous integration.
