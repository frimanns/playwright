# Playwright in VS Code

Using Playwright with Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a great way to write and run end-to-end tests for web applications. Here’s a quick guide to get you started

1. Install the Playwright Extension
    * Open VS Code and go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
    * Search for “Playwright Test for VSCode” and install the extension1.
2. Set Up Playwright
    * Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type Install Playwright.
    * Select Test: Install Playwright and choose the browsers you want to test on (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit).
    * Optionally, you can set up GitHub Actions for continuous integration2.
3. Create and Run Tests
    * The extension will create a tests folder with example tests and a playwright.config file.
    * You can run tests by clicking the green triangle next to the test block or from the testing sidebar2.
4. Debugging and Locators
    * Use the “Pick Locator” feature to identify elements on the page.
    * You can also record tests by performing actions in the browser, which Playwright will convert into test code1
5. Viewing Results
    * Test results, including any errors, will be displayed in the testing sidebar.
    * You can run tests in headless mode or with the browser window open to see the actions being performed2.
